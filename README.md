This project is simulating the ATM behaviour, with the following objectives:

1- The program asks for the name to be able to send a customized welcoming message "this shouldn't be applied in a real scenario"

2- The program checks if the PIN number is correct

3- if the user entered incorrect PIN number 3 times, the card is banned

4- if the user entered the correct PIN he should be able to enter the ATM software

5- The ATM software includes a menu with 4 components "check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit"

6- if the user didn't choose the correct menu item, he will get a fallback response asking him to choose a valid menu item.

7- once the user enters one of the menu items, he will be asked if he still wants to have another service.

8- if the user still needs another service he will get back to the main menu.

9- if not, the program will send send a goodbye message and exit

10- the program allows the user to have many services during a single session

11- the program was written in a way to handle all the exceptions.
